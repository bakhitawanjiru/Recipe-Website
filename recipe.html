Ingredients:2 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons sugar 1/4 cup plain yogurt (or Greek yogurt) 1/4 cup warm milk (or water)  2 tablespoons melted butter (plus extra for brushing) 1 tablespoon olive oil (or vegetable oil) 1/4 cup warm water (for activating yeast, optional) 1 teaspoon active dry yeast (optional for extra fluffiness)Instructions:1. Activate the Yeast (Optional):- If you want an extra soft naan, you can activate the yeast. Mix the warm water, sugar, and yeast in a small bowl and let it sit for 5-10 minutes until it bubbles. If you prefer not to use yeast, you can skip this step and proceed with the rest of the ingredients.2. Make the Dough:- In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.   - Add the sugar, yogurt, milk (or water), melted butter, and oil. If you activated yeast earlier, add it here too.   - Mix everything together until it forms a dough. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour, one tablespoon at a time, until you get a soft and slightly tacky dough. 3. Knead the Dough:- Knead the dough for about 5-7 minutes on a floured surface until it becomes smooth and elastic.- Form the dough into a ball, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rest for 30 minutes. If you used yeast, let it rise in a warm spot for 1-2 hours.4. Roll the Naan:- After resting, divide the dough into 6-8 equal portions.- Roll each portion into a ball and then roll it out on a floured surface into an oval or round shape, about 1/4 inch thick.5. Cook the Naan:- Heat a skillet or non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, place one naan on the pan.- Cook for 1-2 minutes until bubbles form on the surface, then flip and cook the other side for another 1-2 minutes until golden brown. You can press lightly with a spatula to help it cook evenly.- Repeat with the rest of the dough.6. Serve:- Brush each naan with a little melted butter or ghee right after cooking. You can also sprinkle with chopped cilantro if desired."
